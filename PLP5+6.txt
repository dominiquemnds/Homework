1. Code in file.


2) You can put a method behind the main in C++, but you have to declare the method beforehand. Otherwise, all methods go before the main method. Example in file. 


3) Yes, C++ supports recursive functions. Example in code.


4) Yes, C++ supports multiple and unique parameters. Example in code. 
        
5) You can return multiple variables in a return in C++, however, you need to return them as a tuple. (I’ve kept this part of the code commented out. I was getting errors regarding my compiler and I’m not sure how to update it. It should work on a c++17 version compiler.)
        
6) When inilizating a new variable in a loop that shares the same name as an existing variable, each variable is treated as a separate entity. The new variable is limited to the scope of the loop so you will have two variables with the same name but different values. 


7) Even if the variable is inside a function, the variable is treated as a separate entity. 


8) C++ does not feature a global keyword, so each variable is limited to its particular scope.
