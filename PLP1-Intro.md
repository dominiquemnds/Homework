1. What is the name of your language?

C++

2. When/where was it created and by whom? Was it developed to address a particular
computing problem or need?

Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979. It was 
created as an extension of the C language for the purposeof being more flexible and efficient. 

3. Is it primarily procedural, functional, scripted, object-oriented, or a combination of
these? Or something else?

It is primarily procedural and object oriented (according to the information I've gathered).

4. Is it compiled or interpreted, or a combination? Does it use a virtual machine?

C++ is a compiled language. It doesn't require a virtual machine but can be used with one. 

5. What types of applications is your language primarily used for (e.g.: web
development, video games, mobile devices, back-end services, operations
engineering, etc.). If your language is multi-purpose, provide some examples of
different applications it has been used for.

C++ is mainly used for libraries, graphics, games, back-end services, databases, and cloud systems. 

6. Search on Github.com for your language: what are the 3 most popular projects (the
ones with the most stars) involving your language?

The three most popular projects involving my language are "The C based gRPC", "A static analyzer for Java, C, C++, and Objective-C "
and "MessagePack implementation for C and C++ / msgpack.org[C/C++]". The gRPC is a modern, open source, high-performance remote
procedure call framework that can run anywhere. It enables client and server applications to communicate transparently, and simplifies
the building of connected systems. The static analyzer, Infer, is decribed as a static analysis tool for Java, C++, Objective-C, and C.
MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format, which lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON, except that it's
faster and smaller.

7. Where will you get information about this language when it's time to start
programming in it?

I would learn from learn-cpp.org, alison.com, videos and tutorials from /hackr.io, and videos from youtube. I suspect that I'd mostly use learn-cpp.org.
